# 🏥 Population Health Predictive Modeling  
### Predicting high-risk patients using administrative claims data  

This project uses simulated healthcare **claims data** to build predictive models that identify patients at risk for high-cost or high-need outcomes. It demonstrates a real-world healthcare analytics workflow including:

- Data cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine learning model development  
- Model evaluation  
- Interpretability using SHAP  

This type of analysis is commonly used in **ACOs, health systems, insurers, and population health departments**.
